# UC14

UC14 is a versatile React JS application developed to accommodate users from diverse regions by providing content in multiple languages - Ukrainian (UA), English (EN), and French (FR). It is meticulously designed to format numbers, date/time, and currency as per the local standards of the selected locale. The application ensures a smooth user experience by launching without any console errors, rendering HTML content on the landing page, switching between locales seamlessly, and handling missing translations gracefully.
