# UC14

UC14 is a versatile React JS application developed to accommodate users from diverse regions by providing content in multiple languages - Ukrainian (UA), English (EN), and French (FR). It is meticulously designed to format numbers, date/time, and currency as per the local standards of the selected locale. The application ensures a smooth user experience by launching without any console errors, rendering HTML content on the landing page, switching between locales seamlessly, and handling missing translations gracefully.

The application is developed using React and react-i18next to manage the internationalization of the application. It uses the latest features of JavaScript (ES6+) and is built on the Node.js runtime environment, utilizing the npm package manager for dependency management. UC14 is engineered to be user-friendly and robust, ensuring a seamless experience for users from different locales.


## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
